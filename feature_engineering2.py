DESCRIPTION:
    feature_engineering.py is a script that reads the raw data in, engineers
    features for the model, and generates training and testing data sets
    that are used in the construction of the machine learning models in this project.
    This script is called in several other files in this project with the intention
    of streamlining the feature engineering process.
